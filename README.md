### Sentence Generation Using RNN
This is an unfinished work developed as a hobby project and getting aquatinted with tensorflow and RNN model.
Consists modules for cleaning and processing the corpus. 
Corpus is divided into three sets namely train set, valid set and test set. 
The RNN is trained keeping uniform scale of gradients.
The model is trained and in each epoch, a sentence is generated.
This project was my getting started with RNN and tensorflow and might contain sequences of programs from tensorflow tutorial repository and other sources modified to fit my personal implementation.

### Dependencies 
* Python3
* Numpy
* Tensorflow
